      My name is Kim and I am a software engineering student.This project <br />
      displays my skills in front-end development using HTML,CSS, and
      Javascript. <br />
      I was able to create this project with the use of APIs and the data they
      provided. <br />
      My skills in Javascript allowed me to pull data from news and weather APIs
      <br />
      and display them on my website making it interactive for the user and
      allow them <br />
      to search news articles based on keywords, daily weather reports, or
      weekly temperature <br />
      stats for any city.
